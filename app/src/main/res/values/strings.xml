    <string name="dummy">The domestic dog (Canis familiaris when considered a separate species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a wolf-like canid[6] that can be found distributed around the world.[7] The dog descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf[8][9] with the modern wolf being the dog nearest living relative.[10] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[11][10] by hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago,[9] which predates agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior[12] and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
